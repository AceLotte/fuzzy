<b>fuzzy®:</b> fuzzy logic algorithms in Python.

## Definition
The term <b>fuzzy logic</b> was introduced with the 1965 proposal of <i>fuzzy set theory</i> by Dr. Lotfi Zadeh of the University of California at Berkeley, USA.

<b>Fuzzy logic</b> is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth values of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1, considered to be "fuzzy". By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be 0 or 1, often called "crisp" values. Fuzzy logic has been extended to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. Furthermore, when linguistic variables are used, these degrees may be managed by specific (membership) functions.

Fuzzy logic provides a simple way to arrive at a definite conclusion based upon vague, ambiguous, imprecise, noisy, or missing input information. It has been applied to many fields, from control theory to artificial intelligence.

In mathematical logic, there are several formal systems of "fuzzy logic"; most of them belong among so-called <i>t-norm fuzzy logic</i>.
